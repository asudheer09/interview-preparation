collection ---> Interface
If we want to represent group of objects as a single entity.
example : basket contains different fruits, each fruit is object.

Collection is the root interface.
It has 3 child interfaces
1.List
2.Set
3.Queue

1.List
------
1. List is the child interface of the collection.
2. Insertion order is preserved.
3. duplicates are allowed.
4. heterogeneous objects are allowed.
5. implementation classes are : ArrayList,LinkedList,Vector,Stack.

1. ArrayList:
=============
1. default size of ArrayList is 10.
2. ArrayList is one of the implementation class of List interface.
3. internal datastructures is dynamic array.
4. insertion order is preserved.
5. duplicates are allowed.
6. Heterogeneous objects are allowed.
7. If our frequent operation is retrieval then we use ArrayList.

List<String> list= new ArrayList<>();

2. Vector

1. Vector is a legacy class.
2. internal datastructures is dynamic array.
3. All methods in vector are synchronized.
4. insertion order is preserved.
5. duplicates are allowed.
6. Heterogeneous objects are allowed.

ArrayList vs Vector

LinkedList:
0. LinkedList is one of the implementation class of List interface.
1. Insertion order is preserved.
2. duplicates are allowed.
3. heterogeneous objects are allowed.
4. internal data structure is double linked list.
5. If our frequent operation is insertion or deletion then we use LinkedList.

Difference between LinkedList vs ArrayList:

Linked List :
internal data structure is double linked list.
if our frequent operation is insertion or deletion then we use LinkedList.

ArrayList:
internal data structure is dynamic array or re-sizable array.
if our frequent operation is retrieval then we use arraylist.

2. Set
1. Set is the child interface of the collection.
2. Insertion order is not preserved.
3. duplicates are not allowed.
4. heterogeneous objects are allowed.
5. Implementation classes are : HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet.

HashSet:
1. it is the implementation class of Set interface.
2. internal data structure is Hashtable.
3. insertion order is not preserved.
4. duplicates are not allowed.
5. null insertion is possible only once.
6. HashSet introduced in 1.2v
7. heterogeneous objects are allowed.

LinkedHashSet:
1. it is the implementation class of Set interface.
2. insertion order is preserved.
3. internal data structure is LinkedList+ Hashtable.
4. introduced in jdk 1.4 version.
5. heterogeneous objects are allowed.


TreeSet:
1. it is the implementation of Set interface.
2. internal data structure is balanced tree.
3. only homogeneous objects are allowed.
4. null insertion is possible for empty TreeSet.
5. when you add null to the non-empty TreeSet will give null pointer exception.
6. TreeSet will sort the object based on default natural sorting order.

Map:
If we want to store the data in the form of key-value pair then we should use Map.
Map is different from Collection, Map is used to store data in the form of key-value pair where as Collection is used
to store group of objects as single entity.
Each key-value pair is called entry.

Map has the following implementation classes :
HashMap, LinkedHashMap and TreeMap.

HashMap:
1. HashMap is one of the implementation class of Map interface.
2. It is used to store data in the form of key-value pair.
3. key always should unique( duplicates are not allowed in the keys)
4. But values can be duplicated.
5. One null key is allowed and multiple null values are allowed.
6. Internal data structure of HashMap is HashTable.

    public V put(K var1, V var2) {
        return this.putVal(hash(var1), var1, var2, false, true);
    }

How HashMap internally works?

    HashMap<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    map.put("Aman", 19);  ---> internally it will call hash(key) then it will return index value. 1
    map.put("Sunny", 29);  ---> internally it will call hash(key) then it will return index value. 5
    map.put("Ritesh", 39);   ---> internally it will call hash(key) then it will return index value 1

    0--->
    1---> "Aman", 19--> "Ritesh", 39
    2--->
    3--->
    4---> "Sunny", 29

    map.get(key)---> map.get("Ritesh")---> internally it will call hash(key) then it will return index value 1



3. Queue
1. it is the child interface of collection
2. if you want to process the objects based on priority then we will go Queue.

String vs StringBuffer vs StringBuilder

String immutable
( once we create an object we cant change, if we try to change it will create new object)

StringBuffer and StringBuilder mutable.

StringBuffer is thread safe and StringBuilder is not thread safe.

performance point of view StringBuilder is faster than StringBuffer.

final vs finally vs finalize()

final is a keyword, applicable for methods, classes and variables

final class     ---> we cant extend this class.
final variable  ---> we cant change its value once it is assigned.
final method    ---> we cant override that method in the child class.

finally ---> it is a block used in exception handling along with try or try-catch block.

try{

} finally{

}

try {
// risky code
}catch(Exception e){
// to catch exception
}finally{
// resource closing logic
}

finally block always executed whether exception is occurred or not.
only way to stop executing the finally block is writing System.exit(0);
inside finally block we can close the resources or connection closing etc.

finalize() method:

Just before object is garbage collected this finalize() method will be called on that object.

what is garbage collection?
removing un-used or un-referenced objects from the heap memory.

what is immutable class and how to create ?

Immutable means once we create any object and try to modify it, instead of modification it
creates new object.

Example : String , Integer,Float, Long, Character etc.

String s= "hello";

s=s+" world"; // hello world

How to create Immutable class :
1. declare the class as final.
2. declare all the variable as final.
3. provides only getters, no-setters.
4. create constructor to initialize the object.

What is singleton and how to create Singleton?

Singleton means only one object will be created and that object should be re-used.

Use case : while connecting with jdbc we will use this.

How to create singleton?

1. create a class.
2. declare static variable of the same class.
3. create private constructor.
3. define a static factory method that returns same class object.
4. call the static factory method to get the instance of the class.


private and final methods we cant override.

Child child= new Child();

---> By using child class object we can call Child class methods and Parent class methods.

Parent parent= new Parent();

---> By using parent class object we can call only parent class methods.


Parent parent= new Child();

---> By using parent class object we can call parent class methods, but if parent class method
is overridden in the child class then child class overridden method will be called.


Why String is immutable?

immutable means once we create an object we cant modify it,String is immutable in java.

let's assume String is mutable and there are three threads are there, all these 3 threads are using
same String object, if any one thread modifies String then it will be impact for the other two threads.

That's why they made String is immutable.

what is multiple inheritance?

if we extends more than one class at a time is called multiple inheritance.

Example : class C extends A,B{

}

Java doesn't support multiple inheritance through classes , it supports through interfaces.

why java doesn't support ?

class A{
  method1();
}


class B{
  method1();
}

class C extends A,B{

main(){
 C c= new C();
 c.method1();
}
}
Achieving multiple inheritance through interfaces:

interface A{
  method1();
}

interface B{
method1();
}

class C implements A, B{
method1(){
 sout("override");
}
main(){
C c= new C();
c.method1();
}
}

====================

HashMap vs HashTable

HashMap

all methods are not synchronized.
HashMap is faster.
it is introduced in 1.2
HashMap allows one null key and multiple null values.
Iterator returned by the HashMap is fail fast.

HashTable:

all methods are synchronized.
HashTable is slow.
it is a legacy.
HashTable doesn't allow null keys and null values.
Enumeration return by the Hashtable is fail safe.


Fail Fast and Fail Safe:

Fail-Fast means when we iterate over collection object , if some other thread tries to remove object from
the collection then we will get concurrent modification exception then we can say iterator is fail-fast.
Example for fail-fast iterators: ArrayList, HashMap etc.

Fail safe means instead of iterating original collection object, it will create a copy of collection object then
it iterate on the copy then we can say iterator is fail-safe.
Example: CopyOnWriteArrayList


How to create UserDefined or CustomExceptions in Java.

1. create a class and give the class name that ends with Exception. Example: InvalidVoterException
2. extend that class either with Exception or RuntimeException class.
3. create a constructor and call super class constructor from it.
4. use throw class followed by your exception class with error message.
  throw new InvalidVoterException("not a valid voter");

Exception : Exception is an event that disturbs the normal flow of the program execution.

                10 statements
                5--> exception

Exceptions are  types:
1. Checked Exceptions or Compiletime exceptions: occur at compile time.
    Example: InturreptedException, IOException, SQLException
2. Unchecked or RuntimeException: occur at runtime
    Example: ArithmeticException
             NullPointerException
             ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException
             NumberFormatException
             StringOufOfBoundException etc.

How to handle exceptions in java ?

try         -----> risky code
catch       -----> to catch the exception object
finally     -----> it always executes irrespective of exception occurred or not. used to close the resource.
throw       -----> using it you can throw the exception object manually.
throws      -----> inform to the caller about this method may throw exception.

Throwable: it is the parent class for Exception and Error.

try{
  risky code
}catch(Child/Subclass e){

}catch(Superclass e){

}

throw vs throws

throw :
1. throw is used to throw exception manually.
2. throw is followed by an instance of an exception.
    throw new InvaildVoterException("not a valid voter")
3. we cant throw multiple exceptions at a time.
4. throw is used inside a method.


throws:
1. it used to declare an exception.
2. throws is followed by exception class
 public static void someMethod() throws InterruptedException {
        Thread.sleep(2000);
    }
3. we can declare multiple exceptions followed by ,
public static void someMethod() throws InterruptedException,IOException,SQLException {
        Thread.sleep(2000);
    }
4. throws is used inside a method signature.


Error Vs Exception

Exception :
1. Exception can be recovered
2. Exception categorized into 2
    a. checked
    b.unchecked
3. Example: ArithmeticException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException etc.
4. most of the time exceptions are caused due to program code only.

Error:
1. cant be recovered.
2. errors are not categorized and they are always unchecked.
3. Example : OutOfMemoryError,StackOverflowError etc
4. Most of the time errors are occurred due to lack of system resources.














How HashMap internally works?

    HashMap<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    map.put("Aman", 19);

When we call the put() method, then it calculates the hash code of the Key "Aman."
Suppose the hash code of "Aman" is 2657860.
To store the Key-value in bucket in HashMap object, we have to calculate the index.

 Formulae :     Index = hashcode(Key) & (n-1)
                Index = 2657860 & (16-1) = 4

  Here index value is the bucket location where the map want to store the key-value pair.
  If the bucket location is empty then key-value pair will be stored at the bucket location.



 https://www.javatpoint.com/working-of-hashmap-in-java

What is the contract between equals() and hashCode() method.

If two objects are equal by equal() method then they must return same hash code.
Whenever we override equals() method then we must override hashCode() method also.
