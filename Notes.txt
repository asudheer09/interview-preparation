collection ---> Interface
If we want to represent group of objects as a single entity.
example : basket contains different fruits, each fruit is object.

Collection is the root interface.
It has 3 child interfaces
1.List
2.Set
3.Queue

1.List
------
1. List is the child interface of the collection.
2. Insertion order is preserved.
3. duplicates are allowed.
4. heterogeneous objects are allowed.
5. implementation classes are : ArrayList,LinkedList,Vector,Stack.

1. ArrayList:
=============
1. default size of ArrayList is 10.
2. ArrayList is one of the implementation class of List interface.
3. internal datastructures is dynamic array.
4. insertion order is preserved.
5. duplicates are allowed.
6. Heterogeneous objects are allowed.
7. If our frequent operation is retrieval then we use ArrayList.

List<String> list= new ArrayList<>();

2. Vector

1. Vector is a legacy class.
2. internal datastructures is dynamic array.
3. All methods in vector are synchronized.
4. insertion order is preserved.
5. duplicates are allowed.
6. Heterogeneous objects are allowed.

LinkedList:
0. LinkedList is one of the implementation class of List interface.
1. Insertion order is preserved.
2. duplicates are allowed.
3. heterogeneous objects are allowed.
4. internal data structure is double linked list.
5. If our frequent operation is insertion or deletion then we use LinkedList.

Difference between LinkedList vs ArrayList:

Linked List :
internal data structure is double linked list.
if our frequent operation is insertion or deletion then we use LinkedList.

ArrayList:
internal data structure is dynamic array or re-sizable array.
if our frequent operation is retrieval then we use arraylist.

2. Set
1. Set is the child interface of the collection.
2. Insertion order is not preserved.
3. duplicates are not allowed.
4. heterogeneous objects are allowed.
5. Implementation classes are : HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet.

HashSet:
1. it is the implementation class of Set interface.
2. internal data structure is Hashtable.
3. insertion order is not preserved.
4. duplicates are not allowed.
5. null insertion is possible only once.
6. HashSet introduced in 1.2v
7. heterogeneous objects are allowed.

LinkedHashSet:
1. it is the implementation class of Set interface.
2. insertion order is preserved.
3. internal data structure is LinkedList+ Hashtable.
4. introduced in jdk 1.4 version.
5. heterogeneous objects are allowed.


TreeSet:
1. it is the implementation of Set interface.
2. internal data structure is balanced tree.
3. only homogeneous objects are allowed.
4. null insertion is possible for empty TreeSet.
5. when you add null to the non-empty TreeSet will give null pointer exception.
6. TreeSet will sort the object based on default natural sorting order.



3. Queue
1. it is the child interface of collection
2. if you want to process the objects based on priority then we will go Queue.
